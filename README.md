# The-Hottest-Topics-in-Machine-Learning
LDA topic modeling of The NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems)


The NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. These NIPS papers are stored in datasets/papers.csv. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.

The research titles will be analyzed using LDA. Note that in order to process a new set of documents (e.g. news articles), a similar set of steps will be required to preprocess the data. The flow that was constructed here can thus easily be exported for a new text dataset.
